# 🚀 Production Readiness Checklist - EZBOQ.COM

## ✅ Completed Optimizations

### 1. Backend Optimization (Supabase Edge Function)
- ✅ Added DEBUG_LOG configuration toggle
- ✅ Wrapped verbose console.logs with DEBUG_LOG condition
- ✅ Error logging always enabled for debugging
- ✅ HTTP logger disabled by default in production
- ✅ Set ENV=production to disable debug logs
- ✅ Nuclear Mode - Cache-only GET endpoints for maximum performance
- ✅ In-memory cache with TTL (60s)
- ✅ Rate limiting (100/IP, 200/user)
- ✅ Request timeout (10s max)
- ✅ Idempotency support for POST/PUT/DELETE

**To enable production mode:**
```bash
# Set environment variable in Supabase dashboard
ENV=production
```

### 2. Frontend Debug Utility
- ✅ Created `/utils/debug.ts` - centralized debug logging
- ✅ Auto-detects production mode
- ✅ Can be toggled via localStorage: `localStorage.setItem('DEBUG', 'true')`
- ✅ Errors always logged regardless of mode

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { debug } from './utils/debug';

// Instead of console.log
debug.log('🎯 This only shows in development');

// Errors always show
debug.error('❌ This always shows');
```

### 3. PDF Export Optimization
- ✅ Fixed scroll jumping during multi-file PDF export
- ✅ Added scroll position locking during export
- ✅ Improved user experience - no screen movement
- ✅ Maintains current scroll position throughout export

### 4. Responsive Design
- ✅ Mobile-optimized views for all 4 main pages
- ✅ Mobile Card View in BOQTableGrouped
- ✅ Responsive headers, cards, and buttons
- ✅ Touch-friendly interface
