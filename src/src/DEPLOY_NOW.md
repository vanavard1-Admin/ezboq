## 🚀 GO / NO-GO Decision

### ✅ GO if:
- All pre-flight checks pass

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Deploy During Low Traffic
- Best time: Early morning or late evening
- Avoid: Peak hours (10am-4pm)
- Avoid: Fridays (in case issues need fixing over weekend)

### 2. Communicate with Users
```
Before deploy:
"We're deploying a major update at 8pm. 
 Expect 5 minutes downtime."

After deploy:
"Update complete! New features:
 - Auto-save before export
 - Faster page loads
 - Better notifications"
```

### 3. Monitor Closely
- First 30 minutes: Watch like a hawk
- First 2 hours: Check every 15 minutes
- First 24 hours: Check every hour
- After 24 hours: Regular monitoring

### 4. Have Rollback Ready
```bash
# Keep terminal open with this ready to go:
git revert HEAD && git push && ./deploy.sh
```
